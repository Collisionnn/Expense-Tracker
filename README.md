# Expense-Tracker
 Expense tracker developed in React

This expense tracker with dnamically generated arrays will let you add new expenses and filter by year.

This was a first approach to develop a simple web application which will also create a visual chart of the expenses entered.

a dummy array has been entered, so the tracker does not render blank when started (for display purposes).
